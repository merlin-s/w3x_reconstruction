        int: map item table pointer (for dropped items on death)
        if -1 => no item table used
        if >= 0 => the item table with this number will be dropped on death
        int: number "s" of dropped item sets (can only be greater 0 if the item table pointer was -1)
        then we have s times a dropped item sets structures (see below)
        int: gold amount (default = 12500)

        then there is n times a inventory item structure (see below)
        int: number "n" of modified abilities for this unit

        int: random unit/item flag "r" (for uDNR units and iDNR items)
        0 = Any neutral passive building/item, in this case we have
          byte[3]: level of the random unit/item,-1 = any (this is actually interpreted as a 24-bit number)
          byte: item class of the random item, 0 = any, 1 = permanent ... (this is 0 for units)
          r is also 0 for non random units/items so we have these 4 bytes anyway (even if the id wasn't uDNR or iDNR)
        1 = random unit from random group (defined in the w3i), in this case we have
          int: unit group number (which group from the global table)
          int: position number (which column of this group)
          the column should of course have the item flag set (in the w3i) if this is a random item
        2 = random unit from custom table, in this case we have
          int: number "n" of different available units
          then we have n times a random unit structure

        int: custom color (-1 = none, 0 = red, 1=blue,...)
        int: Waygate: active destination number (-1 = deactivated, else it's the creation number of the target rect as in war3map.w3r)

the 4th letter narrows it down to items of a certain level

Random unit ids
random unit ids are of the type char[4] where the 1st three letters are "YYU"
the 4th letter narrows it down to units of a certain level
"/" = any level (ASCII 47)
"0" ... = specific level (this is ASCII 48 + level, so level 10 will be ":" and level 15 will be "?" and so on)
